IMAGE RESTORATION USING WHITE BALANCE AND RETINEX ALGORITHM:

*Image restoration: It is the process of recovering an image that has been degraded by some means, such as noise, blur, or compression. 

*White balance and Retinex algorithm are one of the two techniques that can be used to improve the quality of degraded images.

*White Balance: White balance is the process of adjusting the color of an image to make it look more natural. White balancing is important because different light sources have different colors. If an image is not white balanced, it will look unnatural. There are different types of methods for white balancing. But mainly, in this project, Gray world assumption is used to calculate the average values of the red, green, and blue channels and then the scaling factors for each color channel are computed based on these average values. 

Retinex Algorithm: Retinex algorithm is a method for image enhancement, based on the idea to improve the contrast and color of images. There are different implementations of the Retinex algorithm. Some of them are: Single Scale Retinex, Multi-Scale Retinex, Fast Retinex,etc. In the project, Multi-Scale Retinex is applied.
